Fallout 2 Resting Encounters
------------------

In the spirit of Fallout 1's worldmap resting locations, this mod adds the same for Fallout 2. Stop in the desert -> desert map. Stop over city terrain -> city ruins map, and so on. 

This mod is compatible with Fo2 vanilla, the unofficial patch, and the restoration project - as long as the latest Sfall release is used. 

### Installation
To use this mod, copy the "fo2_resting_encounters.dat" folder into the "/fallout2/mods/" folder and the game will automatically load it.
